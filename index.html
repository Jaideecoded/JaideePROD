            <h2 class="subtitle">About Me</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>For the past four and a half years, I’ve been deeply involved in the music industry, an art form that has captivated me since I was running about in nappies. My love for music is profound, and I’m always trying to expand my knowledge in every corner in this treacherous world of music. My musical roots are firmly planted in the rich soils of 90s boom bap and RnB, so I have always looked up to pioneers like Flipmode Squad, Common, The Alchemist, Mobb Deep, and many others who have left an undeniable mark on the genre.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve spent countless hours mastering FL Studio and Logic Pro X. These tools have become an extension of my creative mind, allowing me to bring you tracks that blend unique samples with powerful drums. I dont know where I'd be without music, more than anything, it's helped me learn to control my emotions and been almost like instrunctions to many chapters of my life.    .</p>
                <br>
                <p>While I started with production, I’ve found that my real passion is in my lyricism. I don’t make music to cater to the market; I make music that people need. My lyrics don't hold up with the modern aspects of hiphop which tend to be a recipe of; Women, Money, Drugs, Guns and things that air around in that area. I get it though, I grew up in Luton and everyone was brainwashed by this traplord dream, even me sometimes. All of my closest people were either selling drugs or scamming the government and I wanted my own hustle that didn't carry the same risks.    </p>
                <br>
                <p>This led me to spend a lot of time alone either writing or producing wherever I could, whenever I could. I spent 2 years travelling the Uk after leaving home at 17 and although I regret it, it helped me build charecter and I probably learned more in them 2 years than I did all throughout highschool.  </p>
                <br>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p>As I continue on this musical journey, I draw inspiration from the ordinary and the extraordinary, from everyday life and unique experiences. I hope that one day, my music will touch someone, offering truth, sparking joy, or simply providing a soundtrack to their life. Until then, I’ll keep chasing melodies, seeking truth, and weaving my existence into every note. I am not just creating music people want, I am creating music people need.</p>
